## Traits

**Staggered.** When Hornet becomes Bloodied, she is Incapacitated and has a Speed of 0 until the end of her next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over her.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Hornet makes two Lunge attacks and either one Throw attack or Gossamer Storm.

**Lunge.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7, reach 5 ft. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) Piercing damage.

**Throw.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7, reach 40 ft. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) Piercing damage.

**Gossamer Storm.** Hornet conjures spinning daggers in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on herself. Each other creature in that area takes 15 (6d4) Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there. A creature takes this damage only once per turn. The sphere disappears at the start of her next turn.
