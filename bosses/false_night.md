## Traits

**Armored.** False Knight has 47 (5d12 + 15) Armor Points. Whenever False Knight takes damage while not having the Stunned condition, the Armor Points takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the Armor Points to or below 0 during a creatures turn, the armor points restore to their maximum, False Knight has the Stunned condition and its Armor Class becomes 10 until the start of that creatures next turn. Whenever False Knight loses the Stunned condition, it makes a Rage attack.

**Leap.** False Knight jumps up to 30 feet next to a creature and makes a Slam attack against it.
**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) Bludgeoning damage.  
**Rage.** Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 14, each creature within 10 feet. Failure: 13 (2d8 + 4) Bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away. Success: Half damage. Additionally, 1d6 barrels fall from the sky, landing at the beginning of False Knights next turn. Each creature hit by a barrel takes 7 (2d4 + 2) Bludgeoning damage.
