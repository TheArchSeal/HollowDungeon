*A large male human with a red scarf and white mask playing an accordion.*

After Troupe Master Grimm has been defeated, Brumm appears in Distant Village and gives the players a [Continual Flame](https://5e.tools/spells.html#continual%20flame_xphb). Next he is found at the Nightmare Lantern where he assists the players in breaking it. Once the Nightmare Lantern is broken, the Troupe is banished and [Nymm](/npcs/nymm.md) appears in Dirtmouth.
