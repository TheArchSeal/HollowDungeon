# [Dream Nail](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Dream_Nail)

*A dagger with a pink shimmering blade. Radiates an aura of divination.*

The item deals no damage and leaves no marks but after stabbing a creature with it, the blade will reveal what is most on the creatures's mind right now. If the creature has more than 20 intelligence, nothing is revealed.
