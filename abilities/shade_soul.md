*A spell scroll containing a long forgotten spell. Seems tougher than most spell scrolls.*

You do not need to have spellcasting to read and cast this spell scroll. When cast, only the text on the scroll crumble to dust and it immediately begins to reform, being fully legible again after the next dawn at which point it can be used again.

Level 3 Evocation

You hurl a ball of fire that pierces each enemy in a 100-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in that line makes a dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. A large or larger creature must make this dexterity saving throw twice.
