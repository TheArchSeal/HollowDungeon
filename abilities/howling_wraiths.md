*A spell scroll containing a long forgotten spell. Seems tougher than most spell scrolls.*

You do not need to have spellcasting to read and cast this spell scroll. When cast, only the text on the scroll crumble to dust and it immediately begins to reform, being fully legible again after the next dawn at which point it can be used again.

Level 2 Evocation

You unleash a horde of sprits forming a deafening cry. Each creature in a 20-foot-cone makes a constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 thunder damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.
