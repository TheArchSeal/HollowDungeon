*The nailmaster teaches you their technique.*

You can take an action to pierce though multiple enemies at a great distance away. Make a melee attack against each creature within a 15-foot-long, 5-feet-wide line in a direction you choose. For each of these attacks you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and each attack you hit is a critical hit. Once you've used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
