# Cyclone Slash

*The nailmaster teaches you their technique.*

You can take an action to rapidly spin around on the spot letting your weapon hitting anyone daring to stand too close. Make three melee attacks against every creature other than you within 5 feet. Once you've used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
