*A spell scroll containing a long forgotten spell. Seems tougher than most spell scrolls.*

You do not need to have spellcasting to read and cast this spell scroll. When cast, only the text on the scroll crumble to dust and it immediately begins to reform, being fully legible again after the next dawn at which point it can be used again.

Level 3 Evocation

You cause a shockwave to spread out through the ground around you within 15 feet. Each creature other than you must make a strength saving throw. Taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone a failed save or half as much without being knocked prone on a successful one. You become immune to all damage and your movement speed becomes 0 and can't increase until the start of your next turn.
