*The nailmaster teaches you their technique.*

You can take an action to slice though multiple enemies at a great distance away. Make a melee attack against each creature within a 10-foot cone. For each of these attacks you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and each attack you hit is a critical hit. Once you've used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
