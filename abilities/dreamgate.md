*A dagger with a pink shimmering blade with yellow strands running along it. Radiates an aura of divination.*

The item deals no damage and leaves no marks but after stabbing a creature with it, the blade will reveal what is most on the creatures's mind right now. If the creature has more than 20 intelligence, nothing is revealed.

Sticking the blade in the ground records a location. You can then cast [Teleport](https://5e.tools/spells.html#teleport_xphb) with a casting time of 1 minute without using a spell slot. The destination is the blades last recorded location and you always end up on target.
