# [Delicate Flower](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Delicate_Flower)

*A very brittle white flower.*

If you take damage, use the stagways or is transported using the [Teleport](https://5e.tools/spells.html#teleport_xphb) spell, the flower is destroyed and becomes a [Ruined Flower](/items/ruined_flower.md).
