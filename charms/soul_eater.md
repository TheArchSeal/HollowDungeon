# [Soul Eater](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Soul_Eater)

*An orb made from a gold. Radiates an aura of transmutation magic.*

When you would expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher and 7th level or lower you can use a bonus action to expend a spell slot of one level lower instead. You must finish a long rest before this item can be used again. *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
