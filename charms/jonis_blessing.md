# Joni's Blessing

*A glass vessel filled with a blue liquid. Radiates an aura of necromancy magic.*

Your maximum hit points is reduced to 1. If you would regain hit points while at 0 hit point you instead become stable. You gain temporary hit points equal to twice the amount of maximum hit points reduced this way when you finish a long rest. If you already have temporary hit points you can add them together instead of choosing one. *(requires attunement)*
