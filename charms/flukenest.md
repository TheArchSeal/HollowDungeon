# Flukenest

*A slimy pink torus made of flesh. Radiates an aura of evocation magic.*

Whenever you cast a damaging cantrip that requires you to make an attack roll you can choose one additional target for its effect. You get a -2 bonus to cantrip attack and damage rolls. *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
