*A blue mushroom with yellow spots. Radiates an aura of conjuration magic.*

When you cast a healing spell. A 10-foot-radius sphere of yellow fog centered on your current location appears. The fog lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can choose any number of creatures. A creature you did not choose this way entering the fog or ending its turn within it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn. *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
