# [Defender's Crest](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Defender%27s_Crest)

*A petrified beetle. Radiates an aura of conjuration magic.*

A 10-foot-radius sphere of brown fog surrounds you. Another creature entering the fog or ending its turn within it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn. *(requires attunement)*
