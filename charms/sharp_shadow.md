*A black stone carved to resemble a set of wings. Radiates an aura of conjuration magic.*

When you are teleported 100 feet or less, each creature other than you in a 5-foot-wide line from the point you were teleported from to the point you were teleported to takes 2d4 piercing damage. *(requires attunement)*
